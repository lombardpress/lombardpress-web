    <h1><%= @user.email %> You've been invited to alpha test the new LombardPress rebuild</h1>
    <p>To visit the site you will need to create a password <%= link_to "here", new_user_password_url %>. You will receive an email when the password has been created. Then you can <%= link_to "sign in here", user_session_url %> with your username (<%= @user.email %>) and the password you created.</p>

    	<p>Your permission level is <%= @user.role %> which means can view both public texts and individual drafts that you have been approved for.</p>

    	<p>You have been approved to view the following texts:</p>

			<table class="table table-striped table-hover">
				<% @user.texts.each do |text| %>
					<tr>
						<% if text.itemid == "all" %>
							<td>All Texts</td>
						<% else %>
							<td><%= link_to text.itemid, "http://" + text.commentaryid + ".lomabardpress.org/text/" + text.itemid %></td>
						<% end %>
							<td>in <%= link_to "http://" + text.commentaryid + ".lomabardpress.org", "http://" + text.commentaryid + ".lomabardpress.org" %></td>
					</tr>
				<% end %>
